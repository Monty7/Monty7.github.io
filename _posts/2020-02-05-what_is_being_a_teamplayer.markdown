What does it mean to be a team player? I realize how ambiguous the answer to this question can be? There is a different response depending on the person. When it comes to software developers, some would want some autonomy in their work but how much autonomy makes the most sense may depend on the nature of the project that youâ€™re working on. 

I noticed that there are some companies that have a pair-programming approach kind-of-culture to find the need to collaborate as the most effective way to code. In my career thus far, I have been on a team in which I was the only developer to code up a mock-up or create a small feature.  When I have found my self collaborating with others that are on a different team than I, it helped me to understand a problem that I would have not have thought of by expanding my options to think outside the box for a good solution to a problem. 

There are benefits to working autonomously as well for I believe that I get to explore my own creativity.  In conclusion, I believe that there should be a balance of autonomy and team collaboration that can bring a project to the best possible results.
