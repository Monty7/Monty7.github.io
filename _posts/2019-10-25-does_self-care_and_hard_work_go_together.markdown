Have you ever got stuck on a problem for hours and can’t seem to figure it out until you decide to take a break or go sleep on it. If you have slept on it, the next day you wake up and you find the solution in 5 minutes or less on the same problem you were stuck on for hours.  That is an example of needing necessary self-care. 

Don’t get me wrong, there are times where one need to burn the midnight oil to complete an important task at hand.  Adrenaline kicks in at that time to give you an extra boost of energy and help you through to completion. Adrenaline is necessary at times but it can be a problem when you rely on it.  It drowns out creativity and cause burn out which leads to lack of productivity regardless of the desire to be productive.

It all boils down to self-care.  You are still a human being that have essential needs.  Making time for self-care is essential to contributing to being as productive as you possibly can.  Some things you can do is take a small break by having a positive conversation with someone.  Go for a walk.  Eat healthy. Exercise. Do yoga. Or simply have a little fun in your life. Know your capacity and know when you need a break.  All of these different ways can contribute positively in your overall wellbeing.  The better you feel, the more productive you can be.
